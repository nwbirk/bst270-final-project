# bst270-final-project

The aim of the following project is to recreate one table and one figure from the FiveThirtyEight article:

["Inside The Political Donation History Of Wealthy Sports Owners"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/inside-the-political-donation-history-of-wealthy-sports-owners/)



# Project Structure

The current project contains two main folders. The first, `scripts`, contains two files: (1) `analysis.Rmd`, the R Markdown file used to generate all analyses and (2) `BST 270 Final Project.html`, the saved html output from the R Markdown file. The second folder, `data`, contains the link to download the dataset, though note that the dataset used in the analysis is automatically downloaded as part of the main analysis script.
